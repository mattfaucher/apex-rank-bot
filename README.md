# apex-rank-bot
discord.py bot that retrieves the rank of a user and assigns them a role in discord based on rank

This bot will require the manage_roles permissions in your discord server in order to work. Simply add the bot to
the server and use the
commands +rankhelp to see the usage of the command +rankme

You will need to register a token with discord for your own application, then register an application with TRN for an API
KEY, enter those two values and BOOM, you have source code for an Apex Ranking Bot!

Deployed on heroku
